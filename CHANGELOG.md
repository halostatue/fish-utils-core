# fish-utils-core Changelog

## 1.0

* Create halostatue/fish-utils-core as a trimmed-down version of
  halostatue/fish-utils. This implements the _minimum_ functionality
  required to support other fish plug-ins I have created use.
  halostatue/fish-utils now depends on halostatue/fish-utils-core.
